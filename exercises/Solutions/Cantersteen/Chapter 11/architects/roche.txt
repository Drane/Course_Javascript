A late 19th century German architect and one of the founders of modern architecture. Van Der Roche worked mostly in the United States and Germany.  He built with starkly beautiful glass and steel, foreshadowing 20th century designers. Van Der Roche worked by the maxim "less is more.” He was considered ahead of his time.

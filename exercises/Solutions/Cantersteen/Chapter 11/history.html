<h3>Introduction</h3>
<p>More information about the history of architectures can be found
on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Architecture#History"
	target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>.</p>
<p>Architecture is the science of designing and making a building.
While architecture is a science, it is also an art. Architecture is the
most useful of the arts as well as the oldest.</p>
<p>The Greeks were among the earliest architects. Greek architecture
has had a profound influence on later forms of architecture. Modern
architecture is one of the newer forms of architecture and is credited
with giving architecture a creative boost. The newest form of
architecture is postmodern architecture.</p>
<h3>Greek architecture</h3>
<p>There are 2 types of Greek architecture: sacred architecture and
secular architecture.</p>
<p>The temple buildings where gods and goddesses were worshiped and
sacrifices were made characterize sacred architecture. Worship of gods
and goddesses took place inside the temples, while sacrifices took place
at the altars outside. Often an altar was built before the temple, but
the earliest monumental buildings were temples. Temples were built to be
strong and were carefully maintained. They had to be replaced only if an
earthquake, a fire, or an attacking enemy destroyed them. A colonnade
that provided shelters for visitors enclosed Greek temples. That is why
some of the buildings are still standing, such as the Acropolis.</p>
<p>Greek cities were social, commercial, and were often governmental
centers for large communities along the sea. In a Greek city there were
public baths, a gymnasium, a stadium, and a theater. Greek sanctuaries
were often in the countryside. Some were famous healing centers.</p>
<p>While revived versions of Greek architecture, such as the White
House and most capitol buildings, stand today in modern cities, new
styles of architecture are more common. One of the most interesting is
Modern architecture.</p>
<h3>Modern architecture</h3>
<p>Modern architecture is totally different from Greek architecture.
Modern architecture foreshadowed how buildings of the future would look.
Modern architecture is characterized by the use of simple shapes and
geometry, and it employs the use of more and different materials than
ever before. The United Nations Headquarters in New York City and the
House on the Rocks by Frank Lloyd Wright are well-known examples of
modern architecture. Wright believed that modern architecture should use
nature and be modeled after nature. This idea became a springboard for
postmodern architecture.</p>
<p>Most modern architecture is constructed of steel with lots of
glass. Modern architects prescribe to the theory, articulated by Ludwig
Mies, that less is more. “Less is more” means that even though a
structure is simple it can still look good. Modern architecture created
by Walter Groupis, Ludwig Mies, and Miles Van Der Rohe prevailed during
the twentieth century. During this time, many architects tried to clone
modern architecture, and many buildings began to resemble ugly, cement
boxes with glass windows. This has given modern architecture a bad name.</p>
<h3>Postmodern architecture</h3>
<p>In reaction to the cement box clones of modern architecture,
Robert Venturi created a new type of architecture—postmodern
architecture. Postmodern architecture began to emerge in the early
1950s. Venturi’s form of architecture was often picturesque and
dramatic, moving away from the "less is more” dictum. The postmodern
architects combined elements of the past, such as columns and arches
borrowed from the Greeks, and added to them the simplicity of modern
architecture to create a medium. Postmodernism joins the past and
present. Buildings such as the opera house in Sydney and Robert Stern’s
graceful beach cottage are well known examples of postmodern
architecture.</p>

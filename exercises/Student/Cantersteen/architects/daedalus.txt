A mythical ancient Greek sculptor, architect, and inventor.  Daedalus built the labyrinth of the Minotaur, which was built for king Minos.  Later, Daedalus was imprisoned by King Minos, but he escaped with Icarus his son, flying with wings of waxed feathers. They flew too close to the sun, melting the wax, and Icarus and Daedalus fell into the sea.
